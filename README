The goal of this piece of code is to transfer particle-level MC
predictions to reconstruction-level observables. In the context
of the measurement of the top mass, this is especially useful
to test systematics uncertainties in a realistic analysis
(typically, the top mass is most precisely measured by fitting
distributions at reconstruction-level that are sensitive to the
top mass).


For an observable defined at both particle-level and reco-level,
one can extract migration matrices A_ij, efficiencies eps_i and 
"fake" hits rates f_acc,j. The migration from bin j (particle-
level) to bin i (reco-level) is then defined as:


	R_i = 1 / f_acc,i * A_ij * (P_j e_eff,j)


where R_i is the number of events in bin i of the reco-level
observable, and P_j the number of events in bin j of the
particle-level observable.
